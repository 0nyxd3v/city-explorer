# City Explorer

**Author**: Nerissa Leynes
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

In this project, we will explore the third party APIs. We will be sending user's request to our third party API, and sould be getting a response back from that API.

The user will be requesting/searching city through the page's form, and should expect a valid result if city exists.

Added is the weather data coming from the Express server. The user is now able to see couple days worth of weather info for a specific city. The app will display error message if not found.

## Getting Started
